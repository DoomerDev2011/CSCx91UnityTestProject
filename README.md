## Unity Installation for school computers:

<ol>

* For this project, we are using the Unity game engine to build out our game and run our code. To begin, make sure you create a Unity Game Engine account on their website [here](https://id.unity.com/account/new). 

<br>

* After you create your account, you will have to install Unity Hub from [here](https://unity.com/download) as this will be the app that will launch all of your Unity projects.

<br>

* After you install Unity Hub, you will need to install the specific version of Unity that we are using for this project to ensure there are no compatibility issues. For this project, we are using Unity version 2020.3.27. You can install this specific version of Unity from [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) under the Unity 2020.x tab

<br>

* Once you have found the Unity version 2020.3.27 download, you will need to right click on the “Unity Hub” button and click “Copy link location”. Afterwards, you will need to find where ''UnityHub.AppImage” is stored on your computer (should be stored in /data/unity on the school computer). Once you have that location, go to that location on your terminal and run the following command: 

<br>

```UnityHub.AppImage "link you copied from the Unity version 2020.3.27 download"```. 
</ol>

It should look something like this:

This should open up the UnityHub installation instructions, in which you will want to install Linux Build support so you can export the project from your computer if need be. Linux Build support can be found in the installation window or can be added later via adding it as a module later.

Afterwards, let Unity finish the version installation and then you should be all set for installing the Unity version and opening the Unity project that you will be pulling.
